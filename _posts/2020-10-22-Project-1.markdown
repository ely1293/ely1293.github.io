## Background
Traditionally, public health planning to improve the health of Americans was based on health estimates limited to the state or county levels. However, over a third of the U.S. population resides within cities, which are only a portion of the overall county or state population; asnd within a city, the health outcomes can differ greatly btween neighborhoods. For example, in [Brockton, Massachusetts](https://www.rwjf.org/en/blog/2017/02/the_500_cities_proje.html), a single neighborhood was found to be more burdened by poor health such as asthma, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol than surrounding areas. Effective public health planning thereby requires health estimates on small geographic areas to design more effective approaches in addressing health needs tailored towards the specific community.

## Motivation
In this project, I created an interactive dashboard using R Shiny visualizing chronic disease risk factors, health outcomes, and clinical preventive services use in the United States on the city and census tract-level to help:
- identify emerging health problems 
- establish and monitor key health objectives

## Dataset
The dataset from [500 Cities Project](https://www.cdc.gov/places/about/500-cities-2016-2019/index.html) contains the crude and age adjusted prevalence, obtained using small area estimation methods, of 27 health measures for the 500 largest American cities. Measures are grouped into three categories as follow:

#### Health Outcomes
1. Arthritis among adults aged >=18 years
2. Coronary heart disease among adults aged >=18 years
3. Current asthma prevalenceamong adults aged >=18 years
4. Diagnosed diabetes among adults aged >=18 years
5. High blood pressure among adults aged >=18 years
6. Mental health not good for >=14 days among adults aged >=18 years
7. Cancer (excluding skin cancer) among adults aged >=18 years
8. Physical health not good for >=14 days among adults aged >=18 years
9. High cholesterol among adults aged >=18 years who have been screened in the past 5 years
10. All teeth lost among adults aged >=65 years
11. Chronic kidney disease among adults aged >=18 years
12. Stroke among adults aged >=18 years
13. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among adults aged >=18 years

#### Prevention
14. Current lack of health insurance among adults aged 18–64 years
15. Mammography use among women aged 50–74 years
16. Visits to doctor for routine checkup within the past year among adults aged >=18 years
17. Cervical cancer screening among adult women aged 21–65 years
18. Visits to dentist or dental clinic among adults aged >=18 years
19. Fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy among adults aged 50–75 years
20. Taking medicine for high blood pressure control among adults aged >=18 years with high blood pressure
21. Older adults aged >=65 years who are up to date on a core set of clinical preventive services by age and sex
22. Cholesterol screening among adults aged >=18 years

#### Unhealthy Behaviors
23. Binge drinking among adults aged >=18 years
24. Current smoking among adults aged >=18 years
25. No leisure-time physical activity among adults aged >=18 years
26. Obesity among adults aged >=18 years
27. Sleeping less than 7 hours among adults aged >=18 years

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Overall Comparison
The first tab allows the user to compare two health measures across all the states within the US and shows the correlation between the two measures. The user may also choose if they want the crude or age-adjusted prevalance. Age-adjusted prevalance allows fairer comparisons between groups with different age distributions, therefore it is automaticall chosen.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project1/US_measure.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project1/scatterplot_measures.png?raw=true"/>

For example, I compared an unhealthy behavior - sleeping less than 7 hours - with a health outcome - mental health not good for >=14 days, which resulted in a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78. Multiple studies have already shown that not getting enough sleep skews one ability to regulate emotions and in the long run, it can increase the risk of developing a mental health condition. This in turn, may cause further sleep disruption. 

### Statewide Comparison
On this tab, the user can compare a health measure's prevalence in all the cities within the state(s) chosen amongst each other and with the overall prevalence in the US as represented by the horizontal black line.

For example, I chose "Current lack of health insurance among adults aged 18–64 years" for three states - California, New York, and Texas. Almost every Texas city has a higher prevalance of residents having no health insurance than the U.S. as a whole while the New York cities fall around the U.S. average. For California, upon closer inspection, cities with a lower median individual income, such as Lynwood, had a higher prevalance of residents having no health insurance while cities with higher median individual income, such as San Ramon, had a lower prevalance of residents having no insurance. This can also explain, why Pharr has the highest prevalance of residents having no health insurance as their median individual income is [$19,983](https://datacommons.org/place/geoId/4857200?utm_medium=explore&mprop=income&popt=Person&cpv=age%2CYears15Onwards&hl=en).

### Citywide Comparision
The last tab features an interactive map that visualizes the small area estimates for regions within cities. The size of the circle markers is proportional to the population of the census tract area and the color correlates to prevalence of that measure - with red indicating a higher prevalance and green indicating a lower prevalence.

One may magnify a city and click on a circle to get more information such as the exact prevalence, the confidence interval, and the population.

## Conclusion
Knowing where a community thrives or suffers is essential to addressing poor health and efficiently utilizing resources to ensure everyone has the opportunity to lead healthier lives. The dashboard is designed to help city officials, public health agencies, and hospitals prioritize key issues in the community health by benchmarking city-level data with national estimates. In addition, the prevalence map helps to determine where improved health services or outreach programs may be needed on the level of very specific neighborhoods.

## Future Works
- Combine the 2019 dataset with previous years' datasets to analyze if there was an improvement or decline in health measure prevalence 
- Join the dataset with a different dataset such as quality measures of Medicare serving hospitals to assess the association between health disparities and healthcare quality
