## Background
Having spent most of my summers in Taiwan, I grew up on Eastern entertainment, especially the television dramas. Even now, I prefer Asian TV dramas over American ones and it's no surprise to me that they are emerging in global popularity. DramaFever, the first subscription video streaming site for Korean, Chinese, and Japanese dramas, founded in 2009, had over 8 million monthly active users by 2015, with [85%](https://www.techinasia.com/dramafever-post-acquisition) of them non-Asian. Viki, another video streaming site dedicated to Asian dramas, currently has [35 million](https://www.techinasia.com/razmig-hovaghimian-founder-of-viki-out-as-ceo) monthly active users. Recognizing this growing demand for Asian dramas, Netflix and Hulu have also started adding them to their selection, with Netflix spending about [$700 million](https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-wants-you-to-binge-watch-more-korean-dramas-11614239854) on both licensing and making their own original Korean dramas between 2015 and 2020. 

## Motivation
In this project, I scraped MyDramaList.com for their wide database of Asian television dramas. I then performed exploratory data analysis to answer several questions that can allow streaming sites to decide which type of dramas to pick up or produce for profitibility: 
- Do ratings have an affect on what dramas are typically consumed?
- Is there a country in which their dramas are gaining momentum besides Korea?
- What media companies (networks) have potential for licensing partnerships?
- Which genres tend to attract more viewerships?

I also created a recommendation system using cosine similarity based on genres in order to help determine what drama one should watch next.

- **actor_1** - The first main actor, _string_
- **actor_2** - The second main actor, _string_
- **rating** - The overall rating by users, _float64_
- **users** - The number of users who rated, _int64_ 
- **watchers** - The number of viewers, _int64_
- **ranking** - The overall position of the drama sorted by how many users rate the drama and what rating they gave, _int64_  
- **popularity** - The overall position of the drama sorted by how many users have the drama in their lists, _int64_
- **genre** - The category (or categories) the drama is characterized into, _string_
- **tag** - The labels attached to the drama for identification, _string_

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Drama countries

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/drama_country.png?raw=true"/>

Among the seven countries, Japan has produced the most dramas in total, followed by China. Korea and Thai rank third and fourth, respectively, and then there is then a significant drop off to the rest of the countries. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/drama_country_year.png?raw=true"/>

Observing the amount of dramas per country by year, however, China surpassed Japan in 2015 and continues to rise, even in 2020, when all other countries decreased in production, likely due to COVID-19. 

### Drama views

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/viewer_country.png?raw=true"/>

View wise, it is apparent that Korean dramas are viewed much more than those of other countries as its views are greater than that of all other countries combined. This can be attested to the global popularity of Korean dramas. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/viewer_country_year.png?raw=true"/>

Observing the amount of views per country by year, Korean dramas exploded following 2008, reaching its peak in viewership in 2016, then sharply declining. This may be because were no dramas that have become a major hit, unlike in 2016 with Descendants of the Sun and Goblin.
Chinese dramas viewership have been steadly rising following 2015 and  surprisingly, Thai dramas are currently ranked third.

### Drama ratings

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/rating_density.png?raw=true"/>

The density plot of ratings for all dramas depict that a majority of dramas were rated between 7 to 8. 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/rating_country.png?raw=true"/>

Average rating country wise, Chinese dramas are rated slightly higher than Thai dramas. Korean and Japanese dramas come in third and fourth, respectively.

### Drama Episodes

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/episode_density.png?raw=true"/>

Majority of drama episodes were fewer than 50.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/episode_country.png?raw=true"/>

Filipino dramas typically have the most episodes, while Japan has the least. It is also interesting to note that there were quite a few dramas within each country with over 100 episodes. 

### Drama genres

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/genre_multi.png?raw=true"/>

All dramas have more than one genre they are categorized into. The top 5 most popular drama genres in regards to all multi-label tags were romance, drama, comedy, family, and historical.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/genre_first.png?raw=true"/>

When considering only the first genre label, romance was still the most popular drama genre, followed by comedy, action, friendship, and historical.

### Top Country?

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/percentage_top100.png?raw=true"/>

Focusing on just the top 100 ranked dramas, it can be observed that Korean dramas make up over three-quarters of them.

### Top Network?

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/network_top100.png?raw=true"/>

Among broadcasting networks, Korean networks expectedly came out on top, with tvN and SBS both ranked first. However, tvN should actually be first as some dramas were broadcasted simultaneously on tvN and Netflix, which is why they were considered together.

### Top Actor?

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/actor_top100.png?raw=true"/>

After combining `actor_1` and `actor_2` into one main actor column, it can be observed that IU and Lee Jong Suk starred in the most top 100 dramas, with three each. 

### Top Genre?

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/genre_top100.png?raw=true"/>

In regards to genre, dramas with a genre of action were featured the most in the top 100, followed by friendship and thriller. 

### Ranking vs. Viewers

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/rank_watchers.png?raw=true"/>

Expectedly, there is a inverse relationship between ranking and the amount of people who view the drama, which means the lower the drama is ranked (= higher ranking number), the less views it will have. However there are slight discrepancies which can be explained by how long the drama has been out for, i.e. dramas that came out earlier have more time to accumulate views. 

### Ranking vs. Popularity

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/rank_popularity_df.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/project2/rank_popularity.png?raw=true"/>

It's interesting to observe how ranking does not necessarily equal popularity, as the top 2 ranked dramas are not included in the top 100 of popularity. However, since ranking is calculated based on ratings, it can be observed that the ratings of the top 100 ranked dramas are all greater than 8.6.

## Drama Recommendation
To create my drama recommendation system based on genre, I first dummified the `genre` column, and then I generated the cosine similarity matrix for all dramas. For a given input drama, a "cosine_score" is calculated which is the cosine similarity with all dramas weighted by the average rating of each drama, and return a sorted list of the top 5 dramas that have the highest cosine score. Naturally, the highest cosine score will come from the input entry, which has perfect cosine similarity of 1 with itself, and likely a high average score (since the user enjoyed the show), so this value is dropped from consideration.

For example, some of my favorite dramas were - The Untamed, Come and Hug Me, and Ashes of Love - which the system then recommended me:

## Conclusion
Overall, Korean dramas continue to dominate the international market even with a decrease in viewership thus streaming services should continue expanding their Korean drama lineup, by either forming licensing partnershps with respective Korean networks to feature their dramas or producing its own originals with popular actors and genres in mind. Nonetheless, streaming services should also note the growing viewership for Chinese and possibly Thai dramas. The current rank 1 drama is The Untamed, a Chinese drama, that is currently avaiable for streaming on Netflix. 

## Future Works
- Scrape the reviews of popular dramas and perform text sentiment analysis to determine what factors are important for a viewer.
- Scrape the list of upcoming dramas and determine the most anticipated ones
